Repo for assignment of Coursera

The script "run_analysis.R" you can find in the repo 
   -merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   -extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   -uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   -creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

It does this for the following data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

I added in the script some additional info on the code that was used to do all the necessary steps to get to the result.

In the codebook you will find some explanation on the codes that are used in the dataset.
